我们从杂志的立意中提取了贵州人这种取自于“山地”的坚韧，挑选了近代贵阳的城市风貌之一的传统招牌字体——行楷。在全书的视觉概念上，将地图本身作为一个设计的概念进行延展。它即是一本真正意义上的地图，也是一本看起来不太像地图的书。山地之上耸立的建筑，地图之中包裹的文字。它将成为这座城市的昨日、今日、明日，直至未来。

We extracted the tenacity of Guizhou people from the "mountain" from the conception of the magazine, and selected Xingkai, one of the traditional signature typeface of Guiyang's urban style in modern times. In the visual concept of the whole book, the map as a design concept. It is not only a map in the true sense, but also a book that doesn't look like a map. Buildings towering above the mountains, text wrapped in the map. It will become the city's yesterday, today, tomorrow, and into the future.
